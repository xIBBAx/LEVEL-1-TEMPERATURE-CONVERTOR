# LEVEL-1-TEMPERATURE-CONVERTOR
I have successfully completed Task three of LEVEL ONE given by #oasisinfobyte using html, CSS and JavaScript. "Temperature conversion is the act of converting a temperature value from one scale to another. The most commonly used temperature scales are Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K).
Celsius is commonly used in everyday life and scientific contexts, while Fahrenheit is often used in the United States and a few other countries. Kelvin is used in scientific and engineering applications where the absolute temperature is crucial. Temperature conversions are important when sharing data across different regions, disciplines, or industries, as well as when performing calculations involving temperature changes, such as in chemistry, physics, meteorology, and engineering. Accurate temperature conversion ensures clear and consistent communication of temperature values and helps maintain precision in scientific analyses and everyday applications."
